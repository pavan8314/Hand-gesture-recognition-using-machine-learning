# Hand-gesture-recognition-using-machine-learning
This project focuses on creating a robust hand gesture recognition system using deep learning. Traditional
methods face challenges with diverse hand poses, prompting the use of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). A comprehensive dataset is collected for training the CNN, enabling it to automatically learn
features crucial for accurate gesture recognition. The system is optimized for real-time responsiveness,
and techniques like data augmentation and fine-tuning are applied to enhance its adaptability and overall
performance. The CNN is trained to process live video input, accurately identifying and classifying hand
gestures. The project emphasizes simplicity and effectiveness, using deep learning to address challenges
and improve human-computer interaction. Rigorous evaluations measure accuracy, precision, recall, and
real-time responsiveness, showcasing the system's reliability in recognizing a variety of hand gestures.
This research contributes to creating an intuitive and adaptable interface for seamless interactions
between users and machines.
